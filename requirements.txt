1. Task Prioritization and Sorting
   Feature: Allow users to set priority levels for tasks (e.g., High, Medium, Low) and sort them accordingly.
   How to do it:
     Add a dropdown or set of buttons next to each task to select the priority.
     Use JavaScript to sort tasks based on the selected priority (you could store the priority in a custom attribute or property for each task).
     Color-code tasks based on priority (e.g., red for high priority, green for low).
  Bonus: Automatically sort tasks whenever a new task is added or a priority is changed.


2. Due Dates & Task Reminders
   Feature: Let users assign due dates to tasks and show visual reminders when tasks are approaching their deadlines.
    How to do it:
    Use a date input field to allow users to select a due date for each task.
    Store the due date in an array or object for each task.
    Compare the current date with the taskâ€™s due date using JavaScript (e.g., new Date()).
    Add visual cues like a red border or highlight for overdue tasks.
Bonus: Show how many days are left until the task is due, or show overdue tasks in a separate list.

3. Task Categories/Tags
   Feature: Let users organize their tasks by adding categories or tags (e.g., "Work", "Home", "Personal").
     How to do it:
     Provide a text input or a dropdown where users can add tags to each task.
     You could store tags in an array or as a string (comma-separated).
     Implement a filter to show only tasks belonging to a certain category or tag.
  Bonus: Use different colors for tasks based on their category or tag.

4. Subtasks
   Feature: Allow users to break large tasks into smaller subtasks.
      How to do it:
      When creating a task, let users add subtasks (use a nested list or input field for each subtask).
      Each subtask can be marked as complete individually, and the parent task can only be marked as complete when all subtasks are done.
  Bonus: You could also allow users to reorder subtasks and make them draggable.

5. Search and Filter Tasks
    Add a search bar that lets users filter tasks by title, category, priority, or due date. 
    This will help users quickly find tasks from large lists. 
    Implementation idea: Implement a search function that filters the displayed tasks based on user input.
    You can use .filter() to filter the array of tasks

6. Undo/Redo Functionality
     Add the ability for users to undo or redo their actions (like adding, deleting, or editing a task).
     Implementation idea: Store the previous state of the task list in an array and use JavaScript to 
     implement undo and redo buttons that revert to a previous state.

7. 10. Drag and Drop
      Add drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks or move them between different categories. 
      Implementation idea: Use the HTML5 drag-and-drop API to allow users to drag tasks into 
      different lists or rearrange them in the current list.

8. Customizable Themes
   Allow users to change the theme of the app (light/dark mode or different color schemes). 
   This can make your app more visually appealing and personalized.
   Implementation idea: Use CSS variables to define theme colors and use JavaScript to 
   toggle between different themes stored in the app's settings.
